    All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. 
    The declaration is not an HTML tag. 
    It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

        HTML tags are classified in two types. 

        - Semantic
        - Non-Semantic

        Semantic Elements: Semantic elements have meaningful names which 
        tells about type of content. For example header, footer, table, … etc. 

        Non-Semantic Elements: Tags like div, span fall under the Non-Semantic 
        categories as their names don’t tell anything 
        about what kind of content is present inside them.

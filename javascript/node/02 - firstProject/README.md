## First project

### How to run ?

- To install all package dependencies run `sudo npm install` if you're on Linux or Mac, or just `npm install` on Windows.
- Run `node usingAxios.js` to execute the program.

### What I have learned ?

- The `package.json` is a configuration file used to describe your project and stipulate dependencies (what other packages it will need to run) and automated scripts.
- `npm init <initializer>` can be used to set up a new or existing npm package.
- The `package-lock.json` is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
